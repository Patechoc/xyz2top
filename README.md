# xyz2top Python Module

<!---

This module provides generates genuine topology files from a molecular geometry provided in [XYZ format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format). Building such a file requires some specific and arbitrary definition of what a molecular bond is and how it is detected.

We will try to summarize here the decisions that leads to our final topology file:

- This module only attemps to identify covalent bonds
- covalent bonds are detected as such as when the distance between 2 atoms is simply smaller or equal to the sum of their respective [covalent radius](http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Chemical_Bonding/General_Principles/Covalent_Bond_Distance,_Radius_and_van_der_Waals_Radius). The sum of the covalent radii can be optionnally multiplied by a coefficient (by default equal to 1) before being compared to the actual distance of the pair of atoms (e.g. if the coefficient is greater than 1., potentially more pairs of atoms will be detected as being connected by a covalent bond).

## Quick start

You can install the xyz2top module simply with the following commands: 
```
git clone https://github.com/Patechoc/xyz2top.git
cd xyz2top
sudo python setup.py install
```

You can install the module locally with a virtual environment and the dependencies that were tested last for passing the tests:
```
git clone https://github.com/Patechoc/xyz2top.git
cd xyz2top
sudo easy_install pip
virtualenv myPackage
source myPackage/bin/activate
sudo ./myPackage/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cd tests; py.test
deactivate
```


## Testing

```
cd tests
py.test -q test_main.py  # to run a single test file
```

or simply the following command for the full test suite:

```
cd tests
py.test 
```


## Dependencies

- elements.py is an external module containing information of the periodic table, among which some experimental covalent radii to atoms used for identifying covalent bond according to our simple model of such bonds.
